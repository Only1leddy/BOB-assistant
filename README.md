# BOB-assistant
Bob is a custom assistant I've built to run on my Raspberry Pi. It uses Python and camera input to interact with the real world. The project includes features like camera streaming, object detection, RTSP/TCP support, and inverted video. This repo is for keeping it safe, sharing updates, and tracking improvements over time.
